## Exporting marked cells
The `dump` function automatically exports cells starting with `#~`, but this behaviour could be changed with the parameter `marker`.

The markers are removed from the output file.

# Exporting cells by indices
You can also export cells using a list of indices.
Consider that the cells will be written regardless of their type.
